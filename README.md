### Open Source

- [c6h6](https://www.c6h6.org/): Developed by the [cheminfo organization](https://github.com/cheminfo), couchDB backend, modular frontend in JavaScript.
- [chemotion ELN](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN): Developed by Nicole Jung's group at KIT, with focus on organic chemistry. Written in JavaScript/Ruby.
- [openBIS](https://openbis.ch/): General purpose LIMS/ELN developed at ETH Zuerich, allows to add custom plugins and direct data analysis in Jupyter notebooks. Core written in Java.
