Your contributions are most welcome!

## Guidelines

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If possible, input the web domain names only, as links to the particular web-pages may expire.
- If there is a GitHub repository, add badges indicating the number of stars and the date of the last commit. If there is more than one GitHub repo for a particular project choose the one which makes it easiest for a user to get started.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Send a Pull Request.
- Add short description in your Pull Request of why the project/resource/tool is awesome.
